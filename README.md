# dtf-setup
Script to setup dtf command (useful for version control of https://github.qualcomm.com/dpassmor/dotfiles)

# install

cd ~

git clone https://github.qualcomm.com/dpassmor/dtf-setup

sh ~/dtf-setup/dtf-setup.sh

(and follow instructions if any are printed)

# after install (Optional)

rm -rf ~/dtf-setup

(This is safe because this repo is just an intall script for { version control of dotfiles repo } and the install script is not needed once dtf command has been installed)
